# FastAPI Example Project

This example project implements a single HTTP endpoint which extracts details from the provided URL.  The endpoint requires a single param `url`.

FastAPI automatically generates documentation for the API, which can be found at `/docs` or `/redoc`

This example is a reimplementation of this project: https://github.com/kotartemiy/extract-news-api, which is build in Flask.
